1) Use git clone from repository on github to be able to run program
2) open up 3 seperate terminals, and move to the folder in each of them
3) To create the clients: 
    in terminal 1 use go run main.go 0
    in terminal 2 use go run main.go 1
    in terminal 3 use go run main.go 2
    
This is due to our program being specifically designed for running 3 clients at the same time.
